 * 30 Days - Lost in Space

 * RGB LEDs have a red, a green and a blue LED packaged into a
 * single LED package.  By using something called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) we
 * can vary the intensity of each LED and come up a wide variety of colors.

 * Parts and electronics concepts introduced in this lesson.

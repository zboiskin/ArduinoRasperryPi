 /*
 * 30 Days - Lost in Space
 * Day 12 - Can you hear us?
 *
 * Learn more at https://inventr.io/adventure
 *
 * Today we will use the Keypad from Day 11 to control musical TONES using a
 * small speaker.  To do this we will show how to take the characters returned
 * by the Keypad library and convert them to musical notes played by our speaker.
 * Tones will play until changed or stopped (by pressing the 'D' button at the
 * bottom right of our 4x4 button matrix)

/*
 * Arduino concepts introduced/documented in this lesson.
 * - libraries: Code provided by others that we can use in our sketches
 * - char type: Represents a single character like 'A', 'd', '4' or '*'.
 * - arrays:    Variables of the same type arranged as a list where each item
 *              can be accessed using an index.  Arrays can be one dimensional
 *              like a list (with one index) or two dimensional like a spreadsheet
 *              table with rows and columns (using row and column indexes).
 * - for loop:  Used to repeately perform actions.

   * For loops:
   * for() has three parts.  Each is part is :
   *              START - operations performed when loop starts
   *              CONDITION - evaluate this condition as a boolean and stop loop
   *                          when false
   *              STEP - operations performed every time for loop ends
   *
   * NOTE: you will often see the short variable names "i", "j" and "k" used
   *       for variables in the for statement.  Those particular letters are used
   *       mostly for historical reasons going back to the FORTRAN language, but
   *       the variables in loops tend to be short in order to keep the for command
   *       readable.  The short names also remind you when used that they change
   *       each time through the loop.
